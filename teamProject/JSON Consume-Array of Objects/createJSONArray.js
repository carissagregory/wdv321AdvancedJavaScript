// JavaScript Document
/*
	This file will:
	
	- Create a Javascript object containing an array of records with each record including an array
	- Convert the Javascript object into a JSON object
	- Store the JSON object into local storage
	
	This will be given to students to run as part of a web page that will consume the JSON object
	Goal: Provide an example of how to create a JSON object in JS

	Use the following data for this object:
